- ðŸ”­ I currently use Github to work on various small POCs basically to jot down notes to myself. One I like to have for basic CRUD capabilities but also demonstrate more complex data manipulations is at [https://www.johnedmiston.com](https://www.johnedmiston.com). Another one is hosted at [https://www.movierank.org](https://www.movierank.org) and cross references several movie scoring sources to "find something good to watch" on one of the major streaming services. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning operations research methods.
